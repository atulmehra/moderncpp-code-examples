# Setting up dev env
## Windows 10. (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

1. Open windows powershell. Type wsl
2. Create directory for gcc. I have pre built the gcc for windows 10 wsl. I will soon upload [here](https://github.com/atulmehra/cpp-tools/upload/master) to my repository. Copy locally to your folder. Add to PATH to the folder.
3. You may have to install extensions for cmake tools. Then press CTRL+SHIFT+P. Choose CMake configure.
4. In VS Code, now you should see gcc11.0.0 configured.
5. Happy modern-cpp-ing. Enjoy.
6. Write back to me eng.amehra@gmail for any issues and I can possibly help you, if you face an issue.
